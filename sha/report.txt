REPORT

1. I have found into the configuration program VARIABLE b32
   which has been setted if your system has 32 bit architecture.
   If you have 32 bit implementations that this variable setting to 
   another way
   -----------
   So, I will use it to configure OpenSSL on OpenVMS on VAX.
 
2. I have found into the ../crypto/include/internal/bn_conf.h_in the next line:
   {- $config{b32}  ? "#define" : "#undef" -} THIRTY_TWO_BIT
   -----------
   So, I will use it to configure OpenSSL on an OpenVMS on a VAX.

3. I have found into the ../crypto/ec/curve448 is not a good implementation
   with header files:


TEST

To test new functions I will use md5.c and Makefile.md5 from sources FreeBSD release 11.3.
This files are in the /usr/src/sbin/md5 directory.
To create _End(), _Data() and _File() functions I will use mdXhl.c from sources FreeBSD release 11.3.
This file is in the /usr/src/lib/libmd directory.

RESUME

The first release of 32 bit implementation SHA is ready.
After compile you will get:
sha512, sha384, sha512t256, sha512t224 - programs which based on a 64 bit implementation;
sha512_32, sha384_32, sha512t256_32, sha512t224_32 - programs which based on a 32 bit implementation.
