1. I have found into the configuration program VARIABLE b32
   which has been setted if your system has 32 bit architecture.
   If you have 32 bit implementations that this variable setting to 
   another way
   -----------
   So, I will use it to configure OpenSSL on OpenVMS on VAX.
 
2. I have found into the ../crypto/include/internal/bn_conf.h_in the next line:
   {- $config{b32}  ? "#define" : "#undef" -} THIRTY_TWO_BIT
   -----------
   So, I will use it to configure OpenSSL on an OpenVMS on a VAX.

3. I have found into the ../crypto/ec/curve448 is not a good implementation
   with header files:
